				<p>Applications Main article: Applications of VR<br /> U.S. Navy personnel using a VR parachute training simulator.<br /> VR has many applications in a variety of fields. It is most commonly used in entertainment applications such as gaming and 3D cinema. Consumer virtual reality headsets were first released by video game companies in the early-mid 1990's. Beginning in the 2010's, next-generation commercial tethered headsets were released by Oculus, the HTC Vive and PlayStation VR, setting off a new wave of application development.</p>
